### About Me: 
Hello, I am Milos from Serbia and I do web development. <br>
As a kid I liked computers. Now, as a grown-up man, I found my passion and I enjoy it. <br>
I enjoy learning new programming languages and frameworks like JavaScript and PHP. <br>
I also like to work in SQL, in fact, I used to do Back End development in CakePHP, but I set focus on Front End, I like it better. <br>
