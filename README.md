### â—† About Me:
Hello, I am Milos from Serbia and I do Front-End web development. <br>
As a kid I liked computers. Now, as a grown-up man, I found my passion and I enjoy it. <br>
I enjoy learning new programming languages and frameworks like JavaScript and C#. <br> <br>
I also like to work in SQL, in fact, I used to do Back-End development in CakePHP, but for now, I set focus on Front-End, I like it better. <br>
Maybe someday I will be ready to be a Full-Stack web developer, but for now, I am so far away from that. <br>
